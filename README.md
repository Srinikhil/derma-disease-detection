## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download the files)**:
    If this project were in a repository, you'd clone it. For now, ensure you have `derma_web_app.py` and the model file in the same directory.

2.  **Model File**:
    You need the pre-trained model file: `derma_disease_detection_VGG16_fine_tuned_colab_finetuned_20241027_202654.h5`.
    Place this file in the same directory as `derma_web_app.py`.

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required Python packages. You can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

    ```txt
    streamlit
    tensorflow
    numpy
    Pillow
    opencv-python
    ```

    Then install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  Navigate to the directory containing `derma_web_app.py` and the model file.
2.  Run the Streamlit application from your terminal:
    ```bash
    streamlit run derma_web_app.py
    ```
3.  The application will open in your web browser.
